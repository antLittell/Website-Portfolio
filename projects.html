                        <p>
                            A group final project from my Computer Programming class. 
                            It is a simple program that translates certain japanese words that are read in from a file on the users computer and outputs them
                            to a translated text file. We used state machines to accomplish this, and all this was done in C++.

                            A group project from my Networking class. This program simulates a blockchain, and some simulated transactions between two users.
                            This program utilized hashing algorithms and socket programming, all done via Python.

                            A solo final project for my Artificial Intelligence class. The program asks the user a series of questions and then based off the answers
                            to those questions, the program tells the user what kind of lizard he/she should buy. This was made with Prolog.

                        <p>
                            This is a VR game in which you, the player, are being chased by a hot air balloon with Will Smith's face on it. Progress 
                            through different environements while you dodge cars, collect powerups, and of course, run away from Will Smith! This is a
                            collaborative project that my friends and I have been working on since March and will be continuing to develop and update, so stay tuned!

                        <p>
                            In this game, you play as a spy who has been sent out by The President to hunt down and defeat Vladimir Putin. Travel accross three different
                            levels, each with its own unique setting, as you gather intel and destroy Putin's bunker. All of this leads up to the final level in which
                            you fight Putin in an epic boss fight. This was another project that me and my friends worked on and we are proud of how it turned out.
