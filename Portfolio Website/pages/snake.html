                Background: This was my first ever game that I coded! I coded it using only javascript and CSS. This was a really fun challenge for me as I had never
                worked on something like this before so the concepts of making a game was totally foreign to me. While this game is a bit rough, I still am proud
                that I was able to make a classic arcade game in only a day.
